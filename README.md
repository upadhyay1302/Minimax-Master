## Features

- Player-vs-Player (PvP) mode.
- Unbeatable AI mode implementing the Minimax algorithm for game moves.
- Random AI mode
- Graphical interface using Pygame.

## Game Instructions

press 'g' to change gamemode (pvp or ai)
press '0' to change ai level to 0 (random AI)
press '1' to change ai level to 1 (unbeatable AI )
press 'r' to restart the game

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```

3. **Run the program:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

- Upon running the program, you can select the game mode: Player-vs-Player (PvP) or against the AI.
- For PvP mode, take turns clicking on the desired square to make a move.
- For AI mode, the AI will automatically make its moves based on the Minimax algorithm.

## Game Modes

- **Player-vs-Player (PvP):** Two human players take turns to make their moves by clicking on the desired square.
- **Unbeatable AI Mode:** Play against an Unbeatable AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves and is unbeatable.
- **Random AI** Play against an random AI which gives a good probability of wining.
